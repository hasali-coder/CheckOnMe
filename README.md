# CheckOnMe

**CheckOnMe** is a privacy-first, peer-to-peer mental health support platform tailored for men. It fosters a safe, anonymous environment where users can share thoughts, engage in meaningful reflections, and connect with others facing similar challenges — without the burden of personal exposure.

---

## Purpose

- Establish an anonymous digital space for mental health support among men
- Facilitate peer matching based on shared life experiences (e.g., grief, fatherhood, burnout)
- Encourage openness and reduce stigma through journaling and group dialogue
- Deliver an emotionally sensitive and user-centric interface

---

## Core Features

- Anonymous entry using autogenerated identities (e.g., *MindfulOtter42*)
- Peer matching through tag-based interests and concerns
- Join or initiate group-based discussions ("Pods")
- Public reflections stream (journal-style submissions)
- Real-time chat integration (planned in future releases)
- Optional mood tracking and check-in tool (under consideration)
